# FiloDB Performance Guide

## **Real Benchmark Results**

I've tested FiloDB extensively using the benchmark tool I built. Here's what I found:

### **Measured Performance**
| Operation | **Actual Results** | Test Details |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Insert Performance** | **1,813 ops/sec** | 50 records, 27.6ms total |
| **Query Performance** | **1,848 ops/sec** | 100 lookups, 54.1ms total |
| **Storage Efficiency** | **0.88 KB/record** | 44.0 KB for 50 records |
| **Average Insert Latency** | **<1ms** | Sub-millisecond operations |
| **Average Query Latency** | **0.5ms** | Excellent lookup speed |

## **Performance Highlights**

### **Why It's Fast**
- **B+ Tree Storage**: Keeps things organized for quick lookups
- **Memory-Mapped I/O**: Works directly with the OS for speed
- **ACID Transactions**: All the safety without sacrificing much speed
- **Concurrent Reads**: Multiple people can read at the same time

### **Real-World Comparison**

| Database | Insert (ops/sec) | Query (ops/sec) | Use Case |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **FiloDB** | **~1,800** | **~1,850** | Educational, Small-Medium Apps |
| SQLite | 1,000-10,000 | 10,000+ | Embedded Applications |
| PostgreSQL | 5,000-50,000 | 50,000+ | Production Applications |

*Honestly surprised by how well it performs for a learning project!*

## **Running Your Own Benchmarks**

### **Automated Benchmark**
```bash
# Run the included benchmark tool
./benchmark.sh
```

Sample output:
```
=== FiloDB Performance Benchmark ===
Insert Performance: ~1813 ops/sec
Query Performance: ~1848 ops/sec  
Storage Efficiency: .88 KB per record
```

### **Manual Performance Testing**
```bash
# Build FiloDB
go build -o filodb

# Time insert operations
time echo "INSERT users 1 Vikash vikash@startup.in" | ./filodb

# Time query operations  
time echo "GET users 1" | ./filodb
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```bash
> stats
=== FiloDB Statistics ===
Database Size: 44.0 KB
Active Tables: 1
Memory Usage: Optimized with B+ tree structure
Transaction Support: ACID Compliant
Concurrent Reads: Enabled
========================
```

## **What Works Well and What Doesn't**

### **What FiloDB Does Well**
- **Really fast operations**: Most things happen in under a millisecond
- **Doesn't waste space**: Each record only adds about 1KB of overhead
- **Decent speed**: Can handle around 1,800 operations per second
- **Reliable**: Full ACID transactions so your data stays safe
- **Smart memory use**: Only loads what it actually needs

### **Current Limitations**
- **Only one writer at a time**: Can't have multiple people writing simultaneously
- **No fancy optimizations**: Queries run pretty much as-is
- **Not built for massive scale**: This is a learning project, not production software
- **Works best with smaller data**: Sweet spot is under 10,000 records

## **Tips to Get Better Performance**

1. **Pick the right data types**: Use INT64 for numbers, BYTES for text
2. **Index what you search**: Add indexes on columns you query often
3. **Group your operations**: Use transactions for multiple changes
4. **Keep an eye on stats**: The built-in stats command shows you what's happening
5. **Test with your own data**: Run the benchmark tool to see how it performs for you

## **Recommended Use Cases**

Based on my testing, here's where FiloDB works well and where it doesn't:

### **Excellent For:**
- Educational projects and learning database internals
- Small to medium applications (< 10,000 records)
- Prototyping and development
- Applications requiring ACID compliance
- Systems with read-heavy workloads

### **Not Recommended For:**
- High-frequency trading systems
- Large-scale web applications
- Analytics with massive datasets
- Systems requiring high write concurrency

## **Why These Numbers Matter**

**FiloDB works well because:**
- I kept the design simple and straightforward
- Memory-mapped files avoid a lot of system overhead
- B+ trees are just really good data structures
- Building it for learning meant focusing on getting things right

**Your results might be different based on:**
- What hardware you're running (SSD makes a big difference)
- How much data you're working with
- What kinds of queries you're doing
- What else is running on your system

**Want to help make it faster?** There's still lots to improve:
- Better query planning and optimization
- Batching writes for better throughput
- Smarter B-tree splitting
- More realistic benchmarks
